                <h2>Why tomatoes and onions the best vegetables?</h2>
                <p> People always ask for no tomatoes and no onions on their burgers. Or when they are eating a hotdog no onions and relish. Every time these two vegetables are removed. But they are some of the best veggies to eat and use as ingredients. It's in spaghetti, guacamole, salsa, pizza the list can go on and on, it's amazing on burgers and hotdogs. Some of you need to grow up, the same goes for bell peppers, broccoli, and cauliflower. And if you are someone who disagrees with your dipping sauces for your chicken tenders have some form of veggies. They will forever haunt you... :D . But what could be the reason why people do not like these veggies? I remember as a kid I hated bell peppers because of how bitter they were but loved carrots because they are oddly sweet. But as I have gotten older I have learned how to make that veggie to be better so now I love eating it. Putting it in everything because I need to eat healthy and oddly prefer to eat veggies more than fruit. Maybe in reality I am just a fruit hater and a veggie-lover, regardless eat your veggies !  </p>

                <h2>Are sweatshirts better or hoodies?</h2>
                <p>  I like wearing long sleeves but have always had a hard time figuring out what to wear. At times hoodies are amazing if it rains you can cover your head. If it snows same thing if it's windy you can hide your hair so it doesn't fly around. But when that is not the case if you have long hair it sucks because it just looks funny at times. But with sweatshirts, they look nice in professional settings. They don't make your hair look funny and you can layer them. But in rain, wind, and snow they cannot save you, plus they would look weird if you could zip them up. In the fashion world, people tend to wear these all year round. Because of how well they work with several kinds of outfits. If you want to look smart while wearing jeans wear a sweatshirt, want to look cool wear a hoodie. They both have their way of making you look, but one thing a hoodie cannot do is look professional. I fear there is at least one thing each cannot do that will forever on my end keep this debate going. Sweatshirts cannot be zipped up because weird and hoodies in a professional setting are not a good idea.   What do you think?</p>
